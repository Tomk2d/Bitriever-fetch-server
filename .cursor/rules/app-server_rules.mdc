# app-server develop rules

## Project Rules
1. You must ensure singleton behavior while preventing circular dependencies.
2. Generally, development is done using lazy import pattern.


## error handling
1. Error handling is performed at the API level.
2. When an error occurs at a stage other than the API, the error is thrown using raise.
3. When an exception occurs, a new error is created by combining the function name where the exception occurred and the error information, and then thrown.
4. Logs are output at the API level. Do not log at other stages.
